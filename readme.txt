Project Title
US Bikeshare Data

Introduction
In this project, I used data provided by�Motivate, a bike share system provider for 
many major cities in the United States, 
to uncover bike share usage patterns. I compared the system usage 
between three large cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington, DC.

Prerequisites

* A text editor, like Sublime or Atom.
* A terminal application (Terminal on Mac and Linux or Cygwin on Windows).

Installing
 A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development environment running.
* To install Anaconda follow the following link and instructions.

Programming Setup
 We need some code editors to carry on this required task. So,Atom which will work on all operating systems. 
If you decide not to use Atom, for first time coders�Sublime�is also popular.

Running Setup
To run the code we can use terminal(for e.g. Gitbash) .
To get the output follow the following instructions:
* All the required files which is to be analysed should be in same folder were code is residing. 
* After getting all the CSVs files and code with saved extension .py, 
then open the terminal and type: python �filename.py�. For e.g.
* After that go per as instructions asked on terminal after entering above instruction.
